                 <p>On April 23, 2000 my Navy journey started at Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes, Illinois. 
                    Nothing I had done to that point prepared me for the mental and physical battle I endured. At the time it was the
                    longest 10 weeks of my life. Despite illness and injuries, I perservered to graduate from basic training. 
                    Unfortunately before moving on to my tech school, I had to stay in Great Lakes for 2 more months to recovery from
                    minor surgery.</p>

                 <h2>Corry Station</h2>
                 <p>In September of 2000 I reported to Corry Station in Pensacola, Florida to begin my technical training.
                    Corry station is the training center for all technical and intelligence jobs in all the branches of the military.
                    My job title was that of Electronic Warfare Technician, or EW for short. The job of an EW is to identify radar 
                    signatures, their function, their platform, and weapons capability. I found my job very interesting and enjoyed
                    learning all the world's military. In December I graduated and was finally able to take leave for the holidays
                    before reporting to my first ship.</p>

                     <h2>Naval Station Bremerton</h2>
                     <p>January 3, 2001 I reported onboard the USS Sacramento (AOE-1). For the next 3 years this would be my command
                        and my home. USS Sacramento called Bremerton, WA it's home port. Bremerton is located directly west of Seattle,
                        across the Puget Sound, on the Olympic Peninsula. Naval Station Bremerton merged with Naval Submarine Base 
                        Bangor in 2004 to form Naval Base Kitsap(Kitsap is the county in which the base resides).</p>

                     <h2>Deployments</h2>
                     <p>The first 6 months onboard USS Sacramento were uneventful. There was more learning and training exercises once
                        onboard to be better prepared for different scenarios that could possible be faced. In July 2001 we set out 
                        for what was my first deployment. Most days were rather boring, but the best part of being in the Navy are the
                        stops made in other countries.</p>

                 <h2>Pearl Harbor</h2>
                 <p>Our first stop was Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Honolulu, Hawaii. Luckily I had made friends with a couple of 
                    shipmates that were from Hawaii and they gave a tour of the island. Hawaii is a beautiful place that I was able to
                    revisit 3 other times during my navy career. It was a great honor to see the Arizona Memorial, to pay tribut to those
                    that were lost.</p>

                 <h2>Singapore</h2>
                 <p>The second stop for the USS Sacramento was Singapore. Singapore is an amazing place. It is a hub for international
                    business and a popular destination for vacationers. Singapore's strict laws help keep it a clean and safe place. 
                    I had the pleasure of being able to return to Singapore in December at the end of my first tour in 2001. They decorated
                    the whole city for christmas with lights and even 30 foot tall Mr. and Mrs. Claus. It is nice to take in other cultures,
                    but at the time it was difficult for myself and others to be away from home for the first time during the holidays.
                    Singapore was a lift up for a lot of us... will always appreciate and love Singapore.</p>

                 <h2>Phuket Thailand</h2>
                 <p>Our third stop happened in Phuket Thailand. It is another popular vacation getaway, with it's beautiful beaches, rainforest,
                    and exciting night life. I have good memories of Thailand, but also one of my worst. We left Phuket on September 11, 2001.
                    And so began a long tour at sea with no stops for 142 days. When it was our turn to rotate out, we made one stop on our way
                    back. That was Singapore.</p>

                 <h2>2nd Deployment</h2>
                 <p>After being at home port in Bremerton, WA for a year, it was time to deploy again. Once again we stopped in Hawaii. It was
                    January 2003 and the Pro-Bowl was going on the same week we were there. Some of the players came to tour Pearl Harbor and 
                    some of the active duty ships. After leaving Hawaii the USS Sacramento was assigned to patrol the waters off the southern
                    tip of Japan and around Guam. We were able to make a stop in Perth Australia for a few days. The Australian people were 
                    incredible nice. I was able to meet a wide range of people while I was there. If there was ever a spot outside of the 
                    United States that I would want to live, Australia is it.</p>

                 <h2>Hong Kong</h2>
                 <p>Hong Kong. Where to begin. Cruising through the straights to get into Hong Kong was mesmerizing. It is mountainous 
                    shoreline with beautiful landscapes and high-rise buildings. Before every port of call there is a brief given of 
                    things to watch out for, local laws, areas to avoid, and other important things to help keep crew members safe and 
                    to be respectful. After the brief that was given on Hong Kong I was a little worried. At the time we were warned about
                    the rivalry between two gangs. That wasn't going to stop me though from taking in the sights. Hong Kong was amazing.
                    The locals were very nice and welcomed us. Once again the night life was exciting. One of my top 3 places I've ever
                    been to outside the United States.</p>

                 <h3>Journey Home</h3>
                 <p>On this second deployment we were out for 10 months, usual deployments are 6 months. At the time there were 2 wars
                    the United States was engaged in. We made a stop in Pusan South Korea, but it was only for a day. Didn't get to see
                    much, but I did manage to get lost in the city and almost had a panic attack. The ship made many stops between Guam
                    and Sasebo Japan for refueling and resupplying. By October we were back at home port, Bremerton, WA. My enlistment
                    to be completed in April of 2004, just 6 short months away, was reduced to January 2004 due to the announcement of
                    the USS Sacramento being decommissioned. On January 4th, 2004 I returned home to Kansas City.
